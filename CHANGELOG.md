# Changelog

All notable changes to LinRAR, newest first.

## 2.0.0

The release this repository starts from: a complete WinRAR-style archive
manager, a one-command installer, and a light and dark theme of its own.

### Interface

- **Light and dark themes**, drawn by LinRAR rather than inherited from the
  desktop, with a matching build of the icon set for each. Switch from
  **Options → Theme**, the corner of the menu bar, or `Ctrl+Shift+T`.
- **Customize** (`Ctrl+U`): choose and reorder the toolbar buttons from a
  catalogue of 34 commands, set icon size and caption style; five file-list
  views (Details, List, Small icons, Large icons, Tiles) with row height, row
  separators and alternating shading; layout control over the toolbar, address
  bar, status bar, folder tree side and comment pane side.
- Every preference is remembered in `~/.config/LinRAR/linrar.conf`, including
  window geometry, splitter positions, column widths, sort order, and the
  compression and extraction options last used.
- Painted chrome glyphs (combo arrows, check boxes, radios, tree twisties,
  scrollbar arrows) so no control loses its indicator to Qt's stylesheet rules.
- Help is a real dialog with three pages; About credits the UI author.

### Archiving

- RAR5 / RAR4 / ZIP / 7z creation with six compression presets, dictionary
  sizes, volumes, solid archives, recovery records, SFX, locking, all update
  modes, encryption including encrypted file names, exclusion masks and
  comments.
- Extraction with update and overwrite modes and a *Confirm file replace*
  prompt; extraction into a folder you do not own asks for administrator
  rights and stages the files rather than running the archive tool as root.
- Convert to a self-extracting **AppImage**, built directly with `mksquashfs`.
- Recovery volumes, volume reconstruction, repair, test, batch conversion and
  TXT/CSV/HTML reports.

### System

- `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh`: virtual environment, system packages, a
  `linrar` launcher, icons at nine sizes, desktop entry, MIME associations and
  right-click entries for Dolphin, Nemo, Nautilus, Caja and Thunar. The
  uninstaller reverses all of it from a manifest and leaves the project folder.
- Twelve package managers, image-based systems (`rpm-ostree`) and NixOS are
  handled; the installer verifies the app actually starts before finishing.
- Administrator rights through `pkexec`, `sudo` or `doas`, authenticated once
  and held for the session; the password is never stored.
- Tools are located through your own setting, `PATH`, and the places distros
  and manual installs use, under every name they ship with.
- Command line: `--extract-here`, `--extract-to`, `--add`, `--test`.

### Fixed along the way

- Combo boxes, spin boxes and scrollbars lost their arrows once the chrome was
  styled: Qt stops drawing a sub-control's own glyph as soon as it is styled.
- Settings stored under a group named `general` were silently discarded on the
  next launch — Qt writes `[%General]` and reads it back as `General/…`.
- A launcher that renamed `argv[0]` broke the virtual environment: CPython
  resolves its prefix from `argv[0]`, so it fell back to the system Python and
  lost PyQt6.
- `rar a -p-` does not mean "no password" — it encrypts with the literal
  password `-`. Read commands get `-p-`; write commands get no `-p` at all.
- The Dependencies manager located tools with `PATH` alone while the rest of
  the app searched further, so a `rar` in `/opt/rar` or a Nix profile was
  reported "Missing" while LinRAR was quite happily running it.
- unrar 7 prints an `Archive comment:` heading above the comment where unrar 6
  printed it bare, so on newer distributions every archive comment gained that
  line — and gained another one each time it was edited. The heading is now
  stripped, and the listing parsers are covered by tests that feed them both
  versions' output, so a tool upgrade cannot silently change what LinRAR reads.
